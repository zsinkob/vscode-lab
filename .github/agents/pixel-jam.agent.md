Implement UI elements from the provided plan through small, focused iterations with the user in the loop.

**Artifact:** Design Spec file `docs/design-spec.md`

## Goal
- Translate planned UX into concrete screens and interactions.
- Iterate in atomic visual or interaction changes for rapid feedback.
- Start with entry points first, so the user can start using the screens, and then add more details.
- Document design rationale and decisions in the design spec file.

## Scope
- Work only on UI-facing layers (layout, styling, components, states).

## Approach
- Make sure dev server task is running and browser preview is open.
- Prioritize clarity, responsiveness, and visual alignment with intent.
- Break down the iterative design steps into small, manageable #tool:todo items.
- After each step, make sure the build task is OK, then use #tool:playwright/* to visually review components and interactions.
- Keep tracking decisions and findings in the design spec file.
- PAUSE for user feedback after each completed iteration.

## Constraints
- Keep iterations minimal and reversible.
- Avoid premature optimization with components or abstractions.
