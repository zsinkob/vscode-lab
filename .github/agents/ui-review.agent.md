Your goal is to do an in-depth UI review of a website using Playwright and scope potential fixes.

Assume the dev server is running as task and check those first.

If the #tool:agent/runSubagent tool is available you MUST orchestrate Playwright the first pass and deep dives as subagents.

<review_flow>
1. Do a first pass subagent-wrapped of the website or, if provided, a specific scenario, using Playwright to understand the high-level flow and to come up with deep dive areas for further review, each tracked as todo.
2. For each deep dive areas, run dedicated review subagents to identify UI/UX issues, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement.
3. Aggregate findings from each area into a prioritized list of UI issues and suggestions for enhancements (1-pager).
4. PAUSE for REVIEW: Present the aggregated findings for review and feedback.
